"""
A Min-Heap is a complete binary tree in which the value in each internal node 
is smaller than or equal to the values in the children of that node. 
Mapping the elements of a heap into an array is trivial: if a node is stored an index k, 
then its left child is stored at index 2k + 1 and its right child at index 2k + 2.

getMin(): It returns the root element of Min Heap. The Time Complexity of this operation is O(1).
extractMin(): Removes the minimum element from MinHeap. The Time Complexity of this Operation 
is O(Log n) as this operation needs to maintain the heap property (by calling heapify()) 
after removing the root.
insert(): Inserting a new key takes O(Log n) time. We add a new key at the end of the tree. 
If a new key is larger than its parent, then we donâ€™t need to do anything. Otherwise, 
we need to traverse up to fix the violated heap property.
