Provide an array of n-1 integers in the range of 1 to n with no duplicates in list, One of the integers is missing in the list. Write a code to find the missing integer.

Examples:

Input : arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]
Output : 4


Input : arr[] = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Output : 3

----------------------------------------

A Min-Heap is a complete binary tree in which the value in each internal node is less than or equal to the values in the children of that node.
Mapping the elements of a heap into an array is trivial: if a node is stored a index k, then its left child is stored at index 2k + 1 and its right child at index 2k + 2.

Operations on Min Heap:

getMin(): It returns the root element of Min Heap. O(1)
extractMin(): Removes the minimum element from MinHeap. O(log N) as this operation needs to maintain the heap property after removing root.
insert(): We add a new key at the end of the tree. If new key is larger than its parent, then we donâ€™t need to do anything. Otherwise, we need to traverse up to fix the violated heap property. O(log N)
Example of Min Heap:

         	5                      11
         /      \               /       \  
       9        13           13         25 
      /                      /  \        /  \
    20                     32    45    95    40
